# YAGL

YAGL (pronouned 'yæ gəl) is a javascript library that can create and render graphs in a 3D [BabylonJS](http://babylonjs.com) scene.  

It's easy to use.

- Create a Babylon scene object.
- Define a graph in a YAGL object or file.
- Create a YAGL GraphBuilder object, passing in the scene object.
- Load your YAGL object or file using one of the functions in the GraphBuilder class.

```
var builder = new YAGL.GraphBuilder(scene);
builder.buildUsingJSONFile(url_of_yagl_file);
```

The builder will build a graph using the specifications defined in the YAGL file and render it in the scene.

## YAGL Files

Graphs are predefined in JSON files.  See template below.
